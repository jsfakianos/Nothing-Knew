## Network 4
**stacking 5 convolution layers**

A brutal professor once asked a question on how to solve a particular thermodynamics problem in class. I confidently spat out an answer and was replied with her laughter and a comment that "I was wearing a tuxedo to milk the cow!" After class she explained that my solution would have led me to the correct answer, but there were simplier ways. _I wish she had said it that way it front of my classmates._

Though, here too, by adding deeper layers we are likely building a bulldozer when all we need is a shovel.

Not only is the result not very good, the model is using a lot more time and energy to train the not-so-good model. Even if your goal is not to create models that are scalable to the point that it can detect whether you and the billions of other Earthlings will "like" the next ad ~~that you are forced to pay to download onto a phone or desktop~~, it's good form to think about what you are doing and how efficiently you are doing it. 

So, how can we improve the efficency of our model?
